This is an android app created by Arseniy Kouzmenkov and Patrisha de Boon

This app allows the user to chose the type of dice they wish to roll, and a random number is then generated based on that choice. 
This app mimics dice rolls for d4, d6, d8, d10, d12, and d20 dice. 

The app will later be modified to be compatible with android wear, and the hope is to use this as an oportunyity to learn how to 
animate using jave in order to show animations of the dice rolls for each of the different dice.
